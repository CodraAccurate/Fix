The API supports multi-language for success and error messages. It automatically takes the language of the user access token.
You can optionally pass the "locale" GET parameter on each request to overwrite the user setting.
 
If no access token and locale parameter is provided, it falls back to english.

The following languages are currently supported:

| Locale Code                |  Description   |
| -------------------------- | -------------: |
| en                         | English  |
